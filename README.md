# Business Value of AI Voice Agents in Mortgage Origination

> **MSc Business Informatics Thesis** — Utrecht University  
> *A mixed-methods single-case study of Better.com's deployment of Betsy, an AI-powered voice loan assistant, built on the ElevenLabs voice platform and integrated with the proprietary Tinman mortgage operating system.*

## Overview

This repository contains the complete research materials, analytical code, datasets, and thesis drafts for an MSc thesis examining the **business value of large language model (LLM)-based voice agents** in regulated financial services. The study uses Better Home & Finance Holding Company (NASDAQ: BETR) as a revelatory single case and triangulates three independent evidence streams:

1. **Qualitative case-study evidence** — Better.com's operating model, Tinman platform architecture, Betsy voice agent, and ElevenLabs integration (sourced from SEC filings, press materials, and vendor case studies)
2. **Longitudinal financial analysis** — SEC-extracted annual financial metrics (2021–2025) benchmarked against Rocket Companies (NYSE: RKT)
3. **NLP customer-discourse analysis** — VADER sentiment scoring and BERTopic topic modelling of 1,915 Trustpilot reviews segmented around Betsy's 17 October 2024 launch date

The thesis is structured around two research questions:

- **RQ1:** How have voice LLM agents been integrated into Better.com's mortgage origination process, and what architectural prerequisites does this imply?
- **RQ2:** What measurable business value can be associated with Better.com's voice AI deployment across operational efficiency, labour productivity, and customer experience?

## Methodology Summary

| Dimension | Method | Tool / Source |
|---|---|---|
| Research design | Convergent parallel mixed methods | — |
| Case selection | Revelatory single case | Better.com (BETR) |
| Financial data | SEC filing extraction, longitudinal descriptive analysis | 10-K, S-1 filings |
| Industry benchmark | Directional comparison (not counterfactual) | Rocket Companies (RKT) |
| Customer sentiment | VADER lexicon-based sentiment scoring | `vaderSentiment` |
| Topic modelling | BERTopic with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings, UMAP, HDBSCAN | `bertopic`, `sentence-transformers` |
| Statistical tests | Welch's t-test, chi-squared / Fisher's exact, Bonferroni correction | `scipy` |
| Causal claims | None — all findings are descriptive and observational | — |

### Key Analytical Constraints
- The analysis is **observational and descriptive**. No causal claims are made.
- Betsy launched on **17 October 2024**; FY2024 therefore blends ~9.5 months pre-launch with ~2.5 months post-launch. The primary comparison window is **FY2024 → FY2025**.
- All financial improvements are attributed to the **broader Betsy/Tinman AI operating model**, not to Betsy in isolation.
- Trustpilot data is self-selected and the post-Betsy corpus (n = 169) is substantially smaller than the pre-Betsy corpus (n = 1,746).

## Key Findings

| Stream | Finding |
|---|---|
| **Financial** | Revenue grew ~52% (2024→2025) while expenses grew ~5.3%; expense ratio fell from 2.89 to 2.01; RPE improved ~42.9% — consistent with AI-enabled operational leverage |
| **Benchmark** | Better's relative efficiency improvement exceeded Rocket's over the same period, suggesting the trajectory is not explained solely by market recovery |
| **Customer — NPS** | Management-reported NPS rose from ~39 to ~64 (medium-reliability, unaudited) |
| **Customer — Trustpilot** | Star ratings declined 4.28 → 3.86 (p = 0.0019, d = 0.29); VADER sentiment declined 0.64 → 0.52 (p = 0.0057, d = 0.25) |
| **AI visibility** | Explicit AI mentions in Trustpilot reviews: ~1.2% pre and post Betsy (p = 1.000) — consistent with voice AI as invisible infrastructure |
| **Topic modelling** | Post-Betsy shift away from refinance topics; Closing Timeline & Process topic share rose ~+3.5 pp |
