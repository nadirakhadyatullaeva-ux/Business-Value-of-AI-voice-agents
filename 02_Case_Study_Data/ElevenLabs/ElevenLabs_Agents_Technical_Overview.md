## Overview

ElevenAgents (now branded "ElevenLabs Agents") is a platform for building, deploying, and monitoring conversational voice AI agents. Agents accomplish tasks through natural dialogue — from quick requests to complex, open-ended workflows.

## Core Architecture (4 Components)

1. **Fine-tuned Speech-to-Text (ASR)** — real-time speech recognition
2. **Language Model (LLM)** — customer's choice of language model, or custom LLM integration
3. **Low-latency Text-to-Speech (TTS)** — 5,000+ voices, 70+ languages
4. **Proprietary Turn-Taking Model** — handles conversation timing, interruption, natural pauses

## Platform Capabilities

### Design and Configure
- **Workflows** — graph-based visual conversation design editor
- **System Prompt** — configurable agent behavior
- **Models** — choice of LLM (including custom / LLM cascading)
- **Conversation Flow** — structured dialogue management
- **Voice & Language** — multilingual, voice cloning, custom voices
- **Knowledge Base** — RAG integration for enterprise knowledge
- **Tools** — function calling / API integration with external systems
- **Personalization** — per-user customization
- **Authentication** — secure identity verification

## Notes on Architecture Coverage

The documentation confirms: (1) the 4-component pipeline architecture is consistent with the case study description in the thesis; (2) ElevenLabs provides enterprise security infrastructure (SOC2, GDPR, Zero Retention) suitable for financial services; (3) the "Agent Workflows" feature supports graph-based conversation design as described for Betsy; (4) tool-calling capability enables the Tinman API integration pattern described in the case study.
